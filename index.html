			<p>All of our fur babies come fully vaccinated and are AKC certified.
			We provide the strictest love, care, and maintenance for our Siberian
			Huskies. We welcome you to first get to know the husky of your choice
			by first spending time and bonding with them (male or female) in our
			A. C. Kennel. Here, you will have options for refreshments and appetizers.
			</p>

			<p>Please be advised, for the safety and protection of our Huskies,
			you will be required to wear a protective gown and wash your hands
			before and after entering and exiting our facility.

			we entrust you will Tell a Friend!!
